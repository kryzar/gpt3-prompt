# prompt_GPT3

## What is this?
* a quick and dirty script to ask things to openAI's GPT3

## How can I use this?
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* `git clone https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/prompt_GPT3/`
* add your license key to a file called "API_KEY.txt"
* `python3 ./prompter.py`

## What are the modes ?
* `cloze` mode is what I used to quickly create flashcards for the spaced repetition software Anki. (note that this supports French and English)

Detailed explanation of the "thalamic switch" hypothesis of anesthesia?
The thalamic switch hypothesis of anesthesia is a theory that suggests that anesthesia is caused by a change in the activity of the thalamus, a region of the brain that plays a role in consciousness. The theory suggests that under anesthesia, the thalamus becomes less active, which leads to a loss of consciousness.
