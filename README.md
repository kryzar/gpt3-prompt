Detailed explanation of the "thalamic switch" hypothesis of anesthesia?
The thalamic switch hypothesis of anesthesia is a theory that suggests that anesthesia is caused by a change in the activity of the thalamus, a region of the brain that plays a role in consciousness. The theory suggests that under anesthesia, the thalamus becomes less active, which leads to a loss of consciousness.
